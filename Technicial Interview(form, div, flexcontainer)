        <h2><span class="highlight">Reflection </span> Questions</h2>

        There are three answers of my preparation for Web Development course.
        First answer is for how to prepare this technical interveiw,I have
        went through the play book that provided by the professor, I mainly
        focus on the notes I have made during the lecture and lab.Second answer
        is to review the in-class website V1 and V2. I went back to the
        checklist for each module and reviewed the codes of html and css.
        The last answer is not only read the codes on by one, but also to
        think what functions these elements can provide, why we write the code
        this way, and what would happen if some attributes are changed.
